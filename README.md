# Trivia Game

This is the fifth assignment for my Coding Bootcamp at Penn University.

It uses a mix of vanilla Javascript for the logic and jQuery for DOM manipulation.


## How the game works

- You are asked one question at a time, and you have 30 seconds to answer.

- You score a win by clicking on the right answer before the time is up.

- You score a loss if the countdown ends, or if you click on a wrong answer.

- At the end of the game, you can see how you did and start over.
